// The game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards.
// The game loop should step through the game turn by turn using only methods from other objects. If at any point you are tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to.
// Create conditions so that the game ends once one playerâ€™s ships have all been sunk. This function is appropriate for the Game module.
